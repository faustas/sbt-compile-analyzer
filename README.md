# sbt-compile-analyzer #

Welcome to sbt-compile-analyzer!

This program allows the extraction of compiler information for the single phases of the `scalac` compilation process. Therefore, the program needs the information that is generated by the `scalac` compiler during its compilation of a software program.

The content of the data file consists of the `scalac` compiler information that can be generated in the following manner. 

Add the following `scalac` compiler option to the build.sbt of the software program that should be analyzed:
  
`scalacOptions ++= Seq("-verbose")`

Run the compilation of the project and generate the data file:
`sbt clean compile > data-file.txt`

Switch to this project and execute one of the following commands:

`
sbt
run absolute/path/to/data-file.txt
`

or

`sbt "runMain com.wegtam.sbt.compile.analyzer.Analyzer absolute/path/to/data-file.txt"`

## Example output

The following two tables represent the result of this program to itself.
